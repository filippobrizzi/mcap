# Build MCAP with CMake

If you want to add MCAP to your C++ project that uses CMake, the [mcap_build](https://github.com/olympus-robotics/mcap_builder) repository provides a helpful wrapper.

The [readme](https://github.com/olympus-robotics/mcap_builder/blob/main/README.md) file in the repository provides all the steps and the context needed.
